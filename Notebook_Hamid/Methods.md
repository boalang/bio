## Sample dataset generation
We have generated a subset of GFF files and assembly statistics files for all fungi folder. The raw data is about 4.21 GB and this subset could be used to test boa queries and reproduce the results.

## data availability
All scripts, our step by step process of scientific discovery, and additional examples of Boa queries used in this paper can be found in our repository https://bitbucket.org/_boa/genomics-sdsi/src/master/.
The raw data files, Boa sequence file and JSON MongoDB file can also be obtained from box https://iastate.box.com/s/xxxxxxxx.  A docker container with Boa scripts, a Boa sequence file of a subset of the raw files and instructions on how to use Boa can also be downloaded from this location.

## Run boa on Docker container and jupyter
* for the subset data, i.e, fungi users can run a containerized version of 3 nodes Hadoop cluster for BoaG as well as jupyter versions on a single machine that users can test and run queries and reproduce the results.
