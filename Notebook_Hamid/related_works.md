* A significant barrier to utilize the Hadoop framework is the difficulty of the interface and the amount of expertise that are needed to write a mapReduce programs. This work tries to abstract a way details of these complexities and open a door for more bioinformatics application. Most applications could be called from mapReduce rather than reimplementing them.
